# Thornwatch Dice Roller
A simple web app built with Sinatra for [Thornwatch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/loneshark/thornwatch), the boardgame by [Penny Arcade](https://www.penny-arcade.com/) and [Loneshark](http://lonesharkgames.com/2016/09/14/launch-of-thornwatch/) games.

I built this since the game isn't available yet and it was simpler to create this rather than paint a bunch of custom d10 dice.

<!-- I added this to your readme.md primarily for myself to remember. I had to ask my husband for help with getting this started (since I have never personally used sinatra before) If you never plan on colaborating or making this open source, then you really don't need this. Otherwise, really nice to have a setup section (even if it seems super simple and obvious.)-->
