# Thornwatch Dice Roller
A simple web app built with Sinatra for [Thornwatch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/loneshark/thornwatch), the boardgame by [Penny Arcade](https://www.penny-arcade.com/) and [Loneshark](http://lonesharkgames.com/2016/09/14/launch-of-thornwatch/) games. 

I built this since the game isn't available yet and it was simpler to create this rather than paint a bunch of custom d10 dice.
